# **P: Introductions:**  {#p:-introductions:}

Howdy\! I’m Myoro. This here is what I hope is a comprehensive list of Relius combos. I’ve gotten most of these from extensive labbing and hanging around with the awesome guys from the Relius Discord\! ([People reading this should prolly join](https://discord.gg/0nnb4SWS418cy4cz)) It’s my honest opinion that anyone who’s hoping to master Relius on a competitive level will benefit from the combos that are found here. There is a lot to cover here because Relius is a character that relies heavily upon meter management, damage/resource optimization, and set-ups\! I’d love to boil it down to the basic theory behind the combos to reduce the sheer bulk of information readers will have to digest, but even I haven’t found a way to adequately do that, so please forgive me if you find the same concepts being repeated every now and then.   
Indeed due to the Relius’ nature, much of his tech is universal in application, IE: you find a way to vinumblockable someone off of one confirm, one can often do so off of every other in a similar fashion. I’ve attempted to streamline this as much as possible, and in doing so I’ve often defaulted to the lowest starter a combo can be done by, instead of showing the same combo doing bigger damage with a better starter. While it may not appear to be the case because there’s a massive wall of combos laying before you, this is self restraint you’re seeing. Believe me.  
Anyway this guide assumes the reader is familiar with [number pad notation](http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=Notation) And there’s a few other terms that will need to be defined for the uninitiated. For those unfamiliar with Relius specific notation and Relius’ fringe tech, I’d take a quick visit to the glossary, where you will find it explained in full. For those looking for basic pick up and go Relius bnbs, please check out the beginner’s short list.  
Now let’s get into it\!

# **T: Basic Combo Theory:**  {#t:-basic-combo-theory:}

What does Relius get out of Combos? Advantage gained from comboing comes in the form of reducing the opponent’s HP, gaining heat at a nearly 190% advantage over the opponent, carrying the opponent toward a corner of his choice, gaining untold real-estate with corner carry, being able to summon or desummon Ignis while mitigating all risk or loss of advantage, gaining the ability to elect to trade a heat for a brand new bar of Ignis, gaining the ability to simply spend Ignis bar to get MORE Ignis bar in the corner, and knocking the opponent down into some of the game’s strongest oki options to create advantageous situations even as the combo ends. All of this serves to extend the advantage one gets off of various hits, and deepen the deficit one’s opponent is placed at while heading toward one of the two win conditions; Reducing the opponent’s HP to zero, or timing out with life lead. There are many kinds of advantages a combo can give one. An optimal combo will give the greatest amount of advantage as according to the current need of the player.  
So How does Relius combo? Relius requires specific confirms to do much, or else he needs to spend resources in the form of heat or his character specific gauge. What limits Relius on the ground is that he possesses no means of continuing a combo outside of his launchers, all of which have their own conditions. 

### **6B**  {#6b}

requires an opponent to be close, but can combo without need of resources into 41236B or TKj.236C. Relius’ tools are most effective in midrange, and you’ll rarely see 2B or 5B being used up close to where they could reasonably confirm into it. 6B’s range also means that most gatlings into it may fall prey to instant barrier, thus causing the 6B to whiff making Relius open himself up to a punish. As such this launcher tends to see play after falling from an aerial normal, on a close range punish that cannot cause a counter hit, or on a fast thinking confirm from 2A. Beware 6B\>41236B requires specific spacing, which is really tight on some characters, and it’s a really costly drop.

### **3C**  {#3c}

is another launcher of Rel’s but it doesn’t have much combo utility without Ignis, and its P2 is dreadful. It can be confirmed with 6D\>662C or 236C, and it doesn’t move the opponent very far away from Relius, meaning it can be used alongside 236C\~214C\>66C if Ignis is not summoned for a costly heavily prorated combo, that still does situationally optimal damage, carries much better.

### **6C**  {#6c}

is the launcher of choice midscreen because as of CF it combos into 41236B for a full bodied combo, but it requires one of many conditions to be met to be combo’d into. You must ether counter hit the opponent with 5B 5C or 2C, use it raw, combo 5C\>6C on crouching or else have Ignis keep the opponent in hitstun with one of her moves.

### **236C**  {#236c}

sees its biggest use in the corner because \~214A lets one bring out Ignis then follow into a full combo. Similarly  \~214C lets one bring Ignis out and combo midscreen, but like 6B it requires a close opponent. The arc of 236C is wider if it’s the launcher as opposed to if one does 3C\>236C, so confirms into 236C\~214C midscreen are usually done from aerials into microdash 5B\>236C or else a confirm into 3C\>236C\~214C. If Ignis is not available Relius can still get damage by rapid cancelling this move into an IAD or a grounded dash to follow up. If Ignis is put away and regenerating this will usually heal her to full.

### **22A**  {#22a}

Has fantastic damage and P2 but it’s very slow and only combos into close 5B meaning it will only be seen as a launcher off of things like 236D, 2363214C, and the like. Can be used on solo oki, and as a starter it’s very economically sound. 

Once the opponent is airborne what Relius is most concerned about is how high the opponent is. Most of Relius’ tools launch the opponent up and away, and that is the limiting condition of his combos, but with careful use of his normals and usage of resources he can extend his combos for longer. Provided you have combo time, moves like 2C 6C and TKj.236C will send an airborne opponent in an arc, where with proper delays, they will end up being at a similar height or even lower than when they were initially hit. 41236B outright brings the opponent downward, but results in a higher bounce depending on how high up the foe was when they were hit. 41236B has poor P2, so being forced to use it early in a combo or multiple times in a combo is simultaneously what gives us midscreen damage and what limits our midscreen damage. Many Ignis moves in the corner, such as 214A \~214A \~214B or 4D reduce the opponent’s height fast, do damage, and can be combo’d from easily, meaning relius can get longer, and more damaging combos in the corner. Overall as a rule of thumb you will get more benefits for keeping the opponent lower to the ground throughout your combo. Things like 41236B loops open up, longer solo Rel combo strings occur, etc.  
When it comes down to it, one actually wants to spend as little Ignis bar as possible in combos. It’s used everywhere, and there’s a limit to how much damage it really adds. A 6D used in a combo could be a 6D used elsewhere in pressure or a j.2D used in neutral, or a 214C used on oki. If you can get good damage without spending, you want to do it, which is why longer, more damaging solo Rel strings are really important. Really how much damage you want for your IG will vary person to person, situation to situation, but given that I won’t kill I usually like to get 500 damage for 1000IG at least.  
Once you meet your goals, you want to maximize damage while keeping knockdown, and that means conserving proration typically.

Moves with a great damage/proration balance best used early combo:  
 5B, 5C, 2C, j.C, 214A, 214C, 236C, j.236C, 6A(Especially if you still have bonus pror),   
4D (Only if you still have bonus pror)

Moves with poor damage/proration balance:   
Jabs, j.B, 3C, 41236B, \~214C, 2363214C

6C is a bit of an outlier, because while it does have poor proration, it has really high damage. \~214B deserves special mention because it is the godking. If you can get \~214B or \~j.214B early in a combo and continue you will almost always raise your damage. This is because it only prorates once in the beginning then every hit done after is unscaled damage. It is the godking, real combo fiber. \~214A is much easier to combo out of though.

## **I: Without Ignis Midscreen:**  {#i:-without-ignis-midscreen:}

Ignis is dead or for some reason she cannot be accessed or summoned in. While the damage values on some of these may be quite low there is untold value being obtained in IG recovery so they are still necessary. Note that all of these no IG using strings that end in 3C can easily go into 3C\>5D if she’s out and needs to be desummoned, or else 22A can be swapped out for summoned or unsummoned 214C if you want much stronger oki. When Ignis is recovering, which is when only these combos will usually be seen, one can consider length of these combos a reward as well because Ignis will be recovering the whole time. Ignis is a resource that can actually become unavailable, so it is crucial to know what exactly can be done when she is not at your disposal.

## **II: Ignis Available but not Summoned:**  {#ii:-ignis-available-but-not-summoned:}

All prior combos can be improved damage wise by going into an air ender by doing 41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B. In all likeliness the combos in the above section will heal Ignis completely, and as \~j.214B costs only 1000IG, bringing Ignis in with this method is cost effective and adds quite a bit of damage. Additionally 236C\>delay \~214A\>214C becomes an ending option to get fullscreen Tus oki. 

Because 41236B\>3C becomes unavailable earlier in the combo timer than 41236B\>5B this means that one can often get a 41236B loop in where one couldn’t before. IE: although   
crouch hit 2A\>5C(2)\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>3C doesn’t work,    
crouch hit 2A\>5C(2)\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B will work. For simplicity’s sake instead of listing all of these combos again in this section slightly modified, I have included a \* next to combos that can have an extra 5B\>2C\>6C\>41236B added in the previous section. Below is a set of combos that bring Ignis in to extend or do special things, like vinumblockables or notably higher damage.

Although Ignis specials are possible without Ignis summoned, combos that use them as starters will only be included in the “With Ignis” sections to limit redundancy.

Add any damage/HT/IG you get from using the 236D combo of choice. This can be done from any 3C. Simply doing launcher 6C\>41236B\>3C won’t work though if Ignis is unsummoned since that increases her start-up, so a 6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>3C segment is usually what’s needed.)

The neutral jump is necessary if the \~ODj.214A doesn’t make them reach the real corner, because it will push them towards the screen’s limit and make 236D link. Can be used from pretty much any starter that can ODc into airhit 2C\>236C 5B\>3C, 6C, Throws, you name it. It regens Ignis completely then vinumblocks, meaning you’ll have the money for sure to follow up. This is spec’d for 3.25 second ODc, any longer and you’ll have OD 236D which doesn’t add much damage and costs 500 more IG. If you are in a lower health OD bracket, and you want to save on IG you have to find ways to draw out the combo after the ODc further.)

## **III: With Ignis Midscreen:**  {#iii:-with-ignis-midscreen:}

With the addition of 6D and summoned 214A some additional routes become available, and it’s far easier to confirm into 6C. Ignis special starters will be put here as well even though they’re technically possible with her desummoned.. All previous combos still work with Ignis out as well. Since Ignis is already out for the 236D, any extended combo into 2363214C can plausibly go into 100 vinumblockables.

### **Sub 1: Midscreen Ignis Regen:**  {#sub-1:-midscreen-ignis-regen:}

Midscreen if you want to regen Ignis it’s going to take a counter hit or meter. Still keeping Relius’ offense going is something that requires doll gauge to be done optimally, and it’s unreasonable to expect to take people out in one bar of IG. These are a must know.

## **IV: Without Ignis Corner:** {#iv:-without-ignis-corner:}

What really changes here is use of TKj.236C becomes readily available combo tool. Again most of the midscreen stuff will work here, but 41236B does have a dead zone close to itself so if you’re too close to the corner you may find it whiffs because 5B\>2C\>6C doesn’t give the same distance as it did before. To that end TKj.236C is valuable as a spacing tool. It’s recommended that it be performed as 7236C 8236C or 9236C depending on what kind of spacing you need at the time. Without Ignis your knockdown options are limited to 41236B\>3C, TKj.236C\>3C, TKj.236C\>236C or options that include meter or EA.

## **V: Ignis Available, but not Summoned Corner:**  {#v:-ignis-available,-but-not-summoned-corner:}

Because of The corner being present, things like 236C\~214A or 6C\>236C\~214B can be followed up, which lets us bring Ignis in. As a result, the bulk of Relius combos in the corner do not actually need Ignis to be summoned to be performed\! The corner also lets us make bigger trades for IG to DMG, but generally outside of Vinumblockables, returns become very low after 4000IG is spent so unless it assures the kill, it’s not worthwhile.

Depending on how close one is to the corner they may need to choose between confirming 236C\~214A into 662C,665B\>2C, or 665B\>214A\>662C. 665B\>214A\>662C allows for the longest confirm range in this situation, so while it costs an extra 1000IG and requires an N starter, it’s worthwhile to know.

Like with before, all combos mentioned in the prior section can be adapted to have aerial enders to bring Ignis in, likely with full IG, however unlike before 5B\>2C\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214A\>3C is an ender which will allow us to get straight into Ignis based oki like 214C. Like before these will go be listed in this section for simplicity’s sake, but it’s important that they are known.

With the addition of 4D’s wallbounce we have the option to go for 6A hard knockdown, which allows for even stronger oki set-ups, or else opt for 22A\>3C which will let us desummon Ignis.

## **VI: With Ignis Corner:**  {#vi:-with-ignis-corner:}

As far as non Ignis starters are concerned, Ignis being out allows for a few small damage optimizations occasionally. It’s actually not super impactful. It does allow for j.236C\~j.214A routes to be accessible easier because you can 6D\>6C, and you can also do HKD 214A for some longer distance corner confirms. In this section It will mostly be Ignis special starters being covered.

# **EX 1: Glossary & Tips:**  {#ex-1:-glossary-&-tips:}

### **S.214X/U.214X:**  {#s.214x/u.214x:}

This stands for (S)ummoned214X and (U)nsummoned214X respectively. This denotes whether Ignis is already summoned usually to give context if none is already given. Using unsummoned versions of moves changes their attributes, and for the majority of moves, doubles their costs. 236C follow-ups and Tedo are exempt from this however as outside of OD they remain constant. When in OD summoned and unsummoned costs are the same, but generally cost more than their normal summoned versions.

### **\~214X:**  {#~214x:}

This merely implies it is done as a follow-up to 236C or j.236C. It is used to differentiate between the non follow-up moves that share the inputs.

### **HKD214A:**  {#hkd214a:}

This stands for (H)ard (K)nock(D)own 214A. At certain heights off of the ground after being hit by 3C or 6A with 214A will cause the opponent to go into hard knockdown. Hard knockdown is a state where the opponent is unable to emergency tech and they are put in guaranteed hitstun, which is useful for combo or oki purposes (Compare 3C which always has soft knockdown to 6A which always has hard knockdown.) It’s unknown if this was intended, however the effect is that we can follow up from 214A midscreen with 66\>IAD\>j.C, 665C(1)\>2C, or 663C. This is important for a few reasons.   
Chiefly it extends our midscreen combos for cheaper than 6D, and the damage/proration for 3C\>214A\>j.C\>2C ends up being better than the damage/proration for 6D\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C, all while giving considerably more carry. The height at which this works is universal and it can work with S.214A or U.214A as long as it meets that height.  
The second reason is that it allows us to cost effectively bring Ignis out midscreen and continue a combo, which is a must if you wish to do a vinumblockable from a solo confirm.  
Unlike other instances of moves gaining hard knockdown HDK214A doesn’t get it at the lowest possible height, but a small margin above that. It’s possible to autopilot into it by doing 6C\>41236B\>3C\>S.214A with earliest timing for studying purposes, but doing so in a match isn’t a very practical application of the technique.

### **Gad Leis Loop:**  {#gad-leis-loop:}

Basically any time we use more than one 41236B midscreen it’s this. It requires a lot of delays, but it brings up damage to around a 3K plateau. To use it you delay as long as you can after any 2Cs and 6Cs in the string. IE: 5B\>6D\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>5B would look like 5B\>6D\>6C\>delay\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>delay\>6C\>delay\>41236B\>5B.  
Typically you want to delay as long as possible while still getting the next part to hit. If it’s the launching 6C you want to hit with 41236B just so 5B can barely pick up after. Keep in mind that Gad Leis’ hitbox gets larger the further it is away from Relius to a certain point, so it will connect easier at a distance. The joint of the robotic appendage is kind of the visual cue for the bigger hitbox. That said with correct delays it will work on anyone from any range, as long as you’re not too deep in the corner. Typically using pushback from other moves leading up to Gad Leis will get you the space you need. TKj.236C, particularly when performed as 8236C or 7236C in the corner, will create enough space to get the larger hitbox on Gad Leis most of the time.  
**\!\!Do note that the midscreen gad leis loop will not work on Tsubaki at close ranges. If Tsubaki touches Relius at all after the first 41236B, the second will whiff outside of fatal combos.**

### **Vinumblockable:**  {#vinumblockable:}

This is an extremely powerful set-up which limits the opponent’s options to near zero and can punish an opponent for waking up and blocking. It uses the fact that hitstun degrades the longer a combo runs. Essentially this is done by first restanding the opponent with 236D late combo, thus eliminating all tech options (including rolls/delay-tech/non-tech.)  
Secondly the super Req Vinum, for which it gets its name, is used. It specifically must be the non-OD version, as that leaves gaps in-between each hit applied. After a small delay Relius uses 2A or 5A and the opponent has their fixed Vinum hitstun overwritten by the jab’s extremely degraded hitstun. The result is that the opponent is knocked out of the combo but the gears do not stop attacking them, and they are forced to use an invulnerable action or else block in 1 open frame.  
This creates a unique situation where the opponent is forced to block for 40ish frames and both Relius and Ignis are not occupied by any actions, which is not a state they’re intended to be in. The result is that Relius can execute an unblockable of his choice while the opponent is helpless to resist. This can be done by using 214D\>5B\>2B\>2C or simply 236D as both will pierce the opponent’s guard and starting a new combo. With proration values restored to the beginning, *it is possible to climb into realms of damage we could only dream of before.* The potential to begin a regen combo immediately after is incredible as well.

### **\~214B/\~j.214B Pick-ups:**  {#~214b/~j.214b-pick-ups:}

Many of these combos use \~214B or \~j.214B early combo to net huge damage. This is done by hitting the falling opponent on the last possible frame as they hit the ground and overwriting their hitstun. Different heights give different timings to follow up, for instance 6C\>236C\~214B when done on the earliest timing will be able to be followed up on frame 10, meaning 5B at its furthest reach or 6B will pick up when timed early as possible, 6B\>236C\~214B can be followed up on frame 11 by 2B. It’s possible and often necessary to manually time the follow-up to pick up though. As a rule of thumb, if you hit them and they still get knocked down by \~214B it was too early, if you whiff, it’s too late.

### **Biotedo Explanation and Character Specifics:** {#biotedo-explanation-and-character-specifics:}

In overdrive Relius is able to combo into the airhit of Bios pretty easily using 214A \~214A/\~j.214A and \~214B/\~j.214B. This offers access to most of OD Bio’s minimum damage, and the last hit can be combo’d into Normal Vol Tedo. This is the optimal way to get damage off of 100 meter and OD on your ender, up until you are beneath 34% HP when triple super becomes available. There is the minor stipulation that you MUST link the 21’s and 22nd hit of OD Bios using 6C or else it will drop. This can work even with 0 combo timer remaining because 6C’s hitstop is long enough to link the two moves pretty easily. Because the opponent is hit inside of hitstop by a super that will seal the burst once more, doing 6C\>236A will always bait bursts on the 6C (Led Ley has identical duration to 6C’s recovery after hitting on its first active anyways, so there’s no point in NOT using Ley immediately after. so as long as it doesn’t force OD Bios to miss hits or drop, you’re able to add as many 6Cs as you want this way.)

The parts leading up to Ignis’ rapid spin are somewhat character specific.

# **EX2: The Beginner’s short list:**  {#ex2:-the-beginner’s-short-list:}

Some strings to practice if one is just beginning. With these in your hands, you can start standing proud on your own two feet as a Relius Clover player\! Be sure to pace yourself and not get impatient. These will take time to learn, and a bit longer to master. Since Relius is a character that rewards good tempo, a calm state of mind will help.

2A\>2A\>3C\>5D \[712DMG/+5HT\]   
^This summons Ignis and you don’t have to really confirm into 236C\~214B. The 2As push the opponent away, so if it’s blocked you will usually have time to block after Ignis is brought in. Great for when you press a button on the defensive and you don’t know if it’s going to hit.

2B\>5B\>6D\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[2750DMG/+19HT/-2300IG\]  
^Eventually you’ll want to learn the Gad Leis Loops, but for now this is a steady way to confirm into damage worry free.

2B\>5B\>6D\>6C\>41236B\>3C\>5D \[1952DMG/+14HT/-1300IG\]  
^As you use Ignis you’ll need solid ways to desummon her. Believe me it’s better to sacrifice some pressure and damage in the short-run and win the long term war. Be sure to follow up with 662A/661A+B once the opponent techs.

2B\>5B\>236C\>Rapid\>66\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[3065DMG/-37HT/-1000IG\]  
^A means of dealing damage when Ignis is otherwise unavailable. Works midscreen. You can add damage by doing Rapid\>IAD\>j.C\>2C\>6C\>41236B instead.

6A\>delay\>6D\>665C(1)\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[3057DMG/+21HT/-2300IG\]  
^A staple way to combo from 6A. If the 6A is blocked, you can 2A after the 6D instead for pressure. 6A forces crouching on hit so that lets us combo into 6C without wasting IG on an additional 6D\!

3C\>delay\>6D\>662C\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[2799DMG/+20HT/-2300IG\]  
^a staple way to combo from 3C. If the 3C is blocked, you can 2A after the 6D instead for pressure.

5B+C or 4B+C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[2885DMG/+20/-1000IG\]  
^A stable throw combo, again Gad Leis loop helps extend damage

5B\>\[6D\>665B\]xN  
^This is quite wasteful as far as combos go. But when done with the timing you use for the combo it is also an airtight blockstring that lets you advance on an opponent. This means it will auto-confirm itself. If you space out your normals and microdashes really well you can get in on opponents who are instant barriering even. A wonderful thing to fall back on when you’re too shaken to think, something that happens once in a while when starting out. Once you get the confirm you can do 6D\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B to convert\! If you can’t crack their guard try throwing out a 6A or a 2B/3C before or after a 6D. You can also dash in and throw after any 6D. If they’re being combo’d you can still throw a high/low or throw out to reset them, as having not left the ground they have no tech options.

5B\>\[6D\>662B\>5B\]xN  
^As above, but this one will open opponents up who think they can jump out\! It doesn’t get you in as fast though. You can cancel into 6A or 3C from 2B for mix-up or a reset as well\!

5B\>\[2C\>jump+6D\>j.C\]xN  
^This is again similar to the other two, but one must be close enough to 2C to use this one. The 6D+jump is done as 9D, as you can do grounded Ignis moves during the first 4 frames of your jump. Ignis enforces the falling j.C letting you re-pressure, or continue the combo. It boasts higher damage, more cost effective Ignis usage, and when used as a blockstring you can use empty jump/late airdash mix-up\! To do this, simply condition the opponent to respect the falling j.C, and then as you fall instead use an airdash as close to the ground and then j.B\>j.C\>follow-up. As an alternative you can simply land then 2B\>5B throw or block a DP. This mix-up is much more swift than 6A vs 2B and is thus much more effective\! If they block you can simply use 2C\>6D+jump and attempt it again.

5B\>6D\>665B\>3C\>2363214C\>5D\>wait as long as possible\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>sj.B\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214B \[3023DMG/-32HT/IG is set to 9000\]  
^Regen combos are really important for keeping Ignis alive and by your side. I’d consider learning one at the very least, it will serve you well\!

XX\>236C\~214A\>2C\>TKj.236C\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>5C(2)\>4D\>6A\>delay\>214C  
^This is our staple corner combo. 5B 6A, and any C button can combo into 236C early on. The TKj.236C is done as close to the ground as you can, but there’s a lot of time to do the input so it’s done as 7236C 8236C or 9236C generally. (you can choose which to help you space yourself from the corner for the next part\!) 2C\>6C\>41236B is easier the further away you are.

XX\>236C\>Rapid\>5D\>2C\>TKj.236C\>2C\>6C\>41236B\>5B\>2C\>j.C\>j.236C\~j.214A\>3C  
^This is a modified version of the previous combo that regenerates Ignis\!

As you come back to these over multiple training sessions, you’ll be able to call on them faster each time. Once you’ve mastered their use, give them a try against opponents, and when you find you need a little more kick or some other confirms fleshed out, return to the main body of this guide\!

# **EX3: Afterwards & Special Thanks:**  {#ex3:-afterwards-&-special-thanks:}

To reiterate, this combo guide is meant to show the upper end of what can be accomplished with this character. Of course, sub-optimal combos can and should be used both in times of stress or simply when high execution is not called for to secure a victory. Sometimes the situation may even call for 2C\>4D loops to bait bursts. Never let it get in your head that this is the end all be all. Always tailor what you do to the situation. 

When all is said and done, this guide is all merely to give its reader an idea of *what can be done*. Studying it should give you the flexibility you need to run the combo you need. How far you choose to take it, as always, is up to you\!

Thank you for your time.
